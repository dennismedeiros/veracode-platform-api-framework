# Veracode Platform API Framework

A Framework of several projects that allow for processing of Veracode XML API data through calls with similar objects and functionality.

## Platform API POJO
A Project to generalize plain old java objects and interfaces to work with the Veracode Platform system data either directly or indirectly.

## Platform API Core

## Platform API Parsers
A Project containing parsers for converting serialized XML objects passed by the Veracode API into POJO class instances. 

## Platform API Provider VOSP
A Project that performs the communication with the Veracode Platform using the Veracode API Framework Objects through a standardized facade interface.   

## Platform API SDK
A Project that contains supporting classes for common functionality used to store, manange, alter, or process platform data.
